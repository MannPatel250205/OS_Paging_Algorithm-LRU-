# LRU Algorithm Implementation in Operating System (JavaScript)

This repository contains an implementation of the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm in JavaScript, specifically designed for usage in an Operating System context.

## Overview

The Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a caching algorithm used in computer science for managing memory efficiently. It works on the principle that the least recently used items are the ones to be removed when the cache is full. This algorithm is widely used in Operating Systems for managing memory pages and improving performance.
